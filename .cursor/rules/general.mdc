# Main directives

**Always** check the following files in `docs/.context/` to ground your answers:

if you have any doubt about my project's:

- **Architecture:** `docs/.context/SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **DevOps/Infra:** `docs/.context/DEVOPS_SPEC.md`
- **Language/Patterns:** `docs/.context/PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGE_CONTEXT.md`
- **Product/Specs:** `docs/.context/ENGINEERING_SPECS.md`

## Critical Workflow

1. If any modification changes the application's structure or business logic, you **must** update the respective documentation file in `docs/.context/` **before or during** the code change.
2. Maintain consistency between the implementation and the `.md` specifications.
3. If a requirement is unclear based on these docs, ask for clarification before proceeding.
